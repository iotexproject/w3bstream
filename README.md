# IoTeX W3bstream (Sprout Release üçÄ)

W3bstream is an integral part of the [IoTeX network](https://iotex.io). It's a Layer-2 protocol orchestrated by the IoTeX Blockchain, dedicated to facilitating decentralized data processing in blockchain ecosystems. W3bstream nodes fetch raw data messages from supported data infrastructures and process them through project-specific ZK circuits to generate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs. These proofs are then dispatched to dApps on different blockchains and verified on-chain, enabling dApps to securely act on validated data insights. W3bstream enhances scalability and trust in blockchain applications, particularly where actions depend on the integrity of real-world data, such as in supply chain management, IoT, or any [DePIN network](https://iotex.io/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin/) where data authenticity triggers significant incentives on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

For the initial setup and operation of a W3bstream node, please refer to the [OPERATOR_GUIDE ‚Üí](./OPERATOR_GUIDE.md)

Developers looking to build circuits and deploy W3bstream projects should consult the [DEVELOPER_GUIDE ‚Üí](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
