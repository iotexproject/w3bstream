## For General Questions About Sprout

Please do not use GitHub issues for asking general questions about this project. Instead, we encourage you to seek support and ask questions in one of the following platforms:

### Join Our Discord Community

For real-time discussions and community support, join our Discord server where we have a dedicated
Developers Lounge category. This is a great place to get quick help, discuss features, and connect with other community members:

[Join the IoTeX Discord →](https://iotex.io/devdiscord)

### Ask on Stack Overflow

For more structured and detailed questions, consider using **Stack Overflow**. Many of IoTeX's core and expert developers prefer this platform for its non-realtime format, which encourages well-structured and comprehensive questions. Ask your question here: 

[Stack Overflow - IoTeX Tag →](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/iotex)

and make sure it's tagged [`IOTEX`].
