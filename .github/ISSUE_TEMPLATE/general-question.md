## For General Questions About Sprout

Please do not use GitHub issues for asking general questions about the Sprout project. Instead, we encourage you to seek support and ask questions in one of the following platforms:

### Join Our Discord Community
For real-time discussions and community support, join our Discord workspace. This is a great place to get quick help, discuss features, and connect with other community members:
[Join Sprout Discord](https://github.com/[YourRepo]/[YourProject]/wiki/Discord)

### Ask on Stack Overflow
For more structured and detailed questions, consider using Stack Overflow. Many of Sprout's core and expert developers prefer this platform for its non-realtime format, which encourages well-structured and comprehensive questions. 
Ask your question here: [Stack Overflow - Sprout Tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sprout)

Remember, a good question on Stack Overflow typically requires some upfront effort. Check out Stack Overflow's guide on [how to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

### Found a Bug or Have a Feature Request?
If you believe you've found a bug or if you have a proposal for a new feature, please use the appropriate issue template to report it.

Thank you for being a part of the Sprout community!
